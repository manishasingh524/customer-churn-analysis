# customer-churn-analysis-Power BI
Customer churn analysis using Power BI with data transformation, conditional columns, and interactive dashboards.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data using Power BI. The goal is to clean and transform the dataset, create meaningful features, and build visuals to understand customer churn patterns.

## Data Transformation
Data preparation was performed in Power Query:
- Renamed columns for clarity and consistency
- Verified and corrected data types

- dashboard_export.pdf – Exported dashboard
